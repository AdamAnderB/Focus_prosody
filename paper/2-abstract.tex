A fundamental challenge in replication studies lies in balancing methodological fidelity with statistical conservatism while also leaving space for deeper theoretical exploration.

We demonstrate this framework by attempting to replicate an in person eye-tracking experiment \citep{Ge2021} using entirely web-based methods.
