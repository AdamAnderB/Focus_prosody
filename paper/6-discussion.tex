%This paper is an attempt at mitigating the risks involved in any potential replication while also ensuring that the replication results, no matter what the outcome, advance our knowledge, however small. 

\subsection{Web-based replication of \cite{Ge2021}}

\subsubsection{Replication vs. Fidelity: a faithful reproduction with minimal changes}

\cite{Ge2021} investigated how L1 English speakers and L1 Dutch-L2 English speakers process focus in English sentences using the "look-and-listen" visual world paradigm. Their study reported two key findings that we set out to replicate: 1) L1 English speakers exhibit significantly earlier fixations to focus-alternative referents compared to L1 Dutch-L2 English speakers because L2 learners struggle to integrate multiple interfaces in real time. 2) L2 learners struggle to acquire focus prosody in the target language in accordance with the Prosodic-Learning Interference Hypothesis \citep{tremblay2016effects, tremblay2021re}, which states that L2 learning of prosodic cues is more difficult when the L1 and L2 use similar prosodic cues as in Dutch-English.

Our fidelity-based replication found some limited evidence for these findings. Whereas we did not necessarily find that L1 speakers used prosodic information earlier, we did find that L1 speakers used prosodic information relatively more efficiently than L2 speakers. That is, L1 Dutch-L2 English speakers showed more early competitor focus fixations than L1 English speakers, suggesting a difficulty integrating multiple interfaces in real time. Although our results revealed some statistically significant differences in eye fixation patterns across object-focused and verb-focused sentences, the nature of these results did not align with \cite{Ge2021}. There are at least three possible reasons for these discrepancies: differences between data collection methods, false positives-negatives, and group-level differences. 

Regarding the difference in data collection methods, \cite{Ge2021} conducted their study in a controlled lab setting, using high-precision eye-trackers with different frame rates depending on the participant group. L1 Dutch speakers were tested in the Netherlands using an eye-tracker with a 500 Hz sampling rate, whereas L1 English speakers were tested in Hong Kong with a 300 Hz sampling rate. Our web-based sample had variable frame rates ranging from 5 Hz to 60 Hz, as is common in web-based eye-tracking \citep{Vos_2022,AOW}. Could it be that capturing eye fixations driven by focus requires a higher sampling rate akin to \cite{Ge2021}'s? The scant eye-tracking studies to examine focus have all used sampling rates at 250 Hz and higher (e.g., \cite{gennari200511, jansen2023influence, mulders2016early}. This is certainly one possibility: webcams are not yet precise enough to capture this level of granularity needed. It is also possible that the look-and-listen paradigm, regardless of the construct being researched, is not ideal for web-based eye-tracking, at least not without constant calibration and attention checks. \cite{Ge2021} noted that a researcher monitored their in-person eye-tracking. Whereas we removed data in which no facial information was recognized, it is unclear whether participants were fully engaged in the task. 

Secondly, the presence of false positives and false negatives in either our study or \cite{Ge2021} could contribute to discrepancies between our results and theirs. While our sample sizes (Dutch = 27, English = 61) are comparable to those of \cite{Ge2021} (Dutch = 35, English = 40), the number of statistical tests conducted per language (9) increases the likelihood of Type I errors. Given this, there is a 59.34\% probability of obtaining at least one false positive in both studies, making it crucial to interpret significant findings with caution. The risk of false negatives is more complex to quantify. If prosodic effects exist but are small, our sample sizes may be underpowered to detect them, leading to Type II errors. However, estimating this risk is particularly challenging due to the lack of established effect sizes for prosody in focus processing. Since this field is still emerging, future research should aim to establish reliable effect size estimates to improve statistical power calculations and minimize both false positives and false negatives. To clarify, we are not claiming that all effects across the two studies are merely false positives but rather that being able to separate the false positives from real effects is not feasible at this stage.

Third, although we followed a similar recruitment strategy to \cite{Ge2021}, differences in L2 proficiency, English exposure, or individual cognitive-perceptual abilities between participant samples may have contributed to the discrepancies in findings. Additionally, while \cite{Ge2021} labeled their L1 English group as a control, this group was recruited in Hong Kong, meaning they may not be directly comparable to other L1 English-speaking populations. Furthermore, exposure to or experience with tone languages like Cantonese and Mandarin may have influenced English focus processing patterns. The greater reliance on lexical pitch in these languages could have heightened participants’ attentional allocation to prosodic cues in English, potentially enhancing sensitivity to focus marking. Indeed, there is evidence that L1 tonal experience improves L2 English stress perception to behavior better than that of L1 listeners \citep{choi2019better, choi2021cantonese}. If such differences in prosodic attention played a role in the original findings, they may not generalize across populations with different linguistic backgrounds, helping to explain why our study did not replicate the same effects. This suggests that focus processing may be more variable than previously assumed, and that group-level trends in prosodic cue integration may not be as stable across studies. 

Finally, our fidelity-based replication did not test for direct interactions between language groups. This was because \cite{Ge2021} conducted separate statistical analyses for each group, meaning that group-level differences were inferred rather than explicitly tested via interaction effects. The fact that our study did not replicate these key findings from \cite{Ge2021} highlights the complexities of replication in psycholinguistics. This methodological limitation raises concerns about the robustness of previously reported L1-L2 differences, particularly given the potential for false positives when conducting multiple separate statistical tests. If group differences were found in one study but not another, this does not necessarily indicate a true underlying cognitive difference; rather, it could be the result of analytical choices or sample variability. This is particularly important when working with small effect sizes, where statistical significance may not always equate to meaningful or replicable findings. Given these considerations, our fidelity replication highlights the importance of directly testing interactions which we in turn did in our refinement.


\subsection{Replication vs. refinement: Balancing rigor and practicality}

A key limitation of both our fidelity replication and the original study by \cite{Ge2021} is the separation of L1 English and L1 Dutch participants into independent statistical models. Whereas this approach may have been necessary in \cite{Ge2021} due to differences in eye-tracking sampling rates across participant groups, it prevented a direct statistical test of whether group differences were robust or whether they emerged as an artifact of separate analyses. To address this, we refined our analysis by adopting a time-sensitive model that accounts for gradual fixation changes across each phrase rather than treating time as discrete bins. Using Generalized Additive Models (GAMs), we assessed whether prosodic effects emerged immediately or developed over time. This refined approach allowed us to test whether L1 speakers truly showed an early fixation advantage and whether L2 speakers were uniformly delayed in processing prosodic focus cues.

The refined analysis produced three key findings that deepen our understanding of prosodic cue integration. First, in \cite{Ge2021}, L1 English speakers were reported to fixate on focus-marked referents earlier than L1 Dutch-L2 English speakers. However, our target model and competitor model for phrase one did not find an effect of L1 early in processing. Instead, fixation patterns gradually increased over time, as shown by an effect of time with object focus leading to greater fixations. This means that fixations to the target did not shift immediately following prosodic cues, but rather developed dynamically over time.

Second, rather than revealing a uniform L2 delay, our results show that L1 Dutch-L2 English speakers were not consistently slower than L1 English speakers in processing prosodic focus cues. In fact, the interaction between stress and L1 indicates this difference is negative for both target and competitors models indicating fewer looks overall rather than an L1 advantage. This contradicts the expectation that L1 Dutch-L2 English participants should show a general delay in focus-driven fixations. However, a three-way interaction between time, L1, and stress revealed that L1 English speakers gradually developed a fixation preference for the target in verb-stressed sentences. This suggests that while Dutch speakers did not initially lag behind, L1 English speakers showed a more stable late-stage fixation pattern over the first phrase. In other words, the L1 speaker advantage may be one of long-term consistency rather than early efficiency.

Third, our refined approach revealed that group-level differences may have been previously overstated due to statistical modeling choices. In \cite{Ge2021}, L1 and L2 differences were inferred from separate statistical models rather than directly tested as an interaction. Our unified model revealed a negative interaction between L1 and stress in the first phrase competitor model, indicating that English speakers showed fewer fixations to the competitor during verb-stressed sentences. At the same time, a negative interaction between time and stress showed that fixations to the competitor decreased more sharply for English speakers as time progressed. These findings indicate that differences between L1 and L2 participants were not static processing deficits but instead emerged gradually through dynamic changes in fixation patterns over time.

These results have key implications for how we interpret prosodic focus effects in L1 and L2 processing. If focus-driven fixations are not immediate, then L2 delays may not reflect an inherent cognitive limitation integrating multiple interfaces (cf. \cite{sorace2006anaphora,sorace2011pinning}) but rather a difference in cue weighting over time. The fact that L1-L2 differences were highly sensitive to analytical approach underscores the need for caution when making strong claims about group differences based on discrete time bins.

Importantly, our refined analysis does not overturn the key findings of \cite{Ge2021}, rather it suggests that their interpretation may have been overly rigid. As opposed to a clear and immediate L1 advantage, our results indicate that prosodic cue integration is dynamic, shifting over time rather than appearing as a static group-level effect. By adopting an approach that accounts for these time-dependent changes, we provide a more nuanced understanding of how both L1 and L2 speakers process prosodic focus cues.

\subsection{Exploratory Extension}

The replication and refinement analyses established that prosodic focus effects were not robust across all conditions, raising questions about the factors that shape fixation patterns in real-time speech processing. Whereas methodological fidelity and statistical rigor allowed us to test for consistency with \cite{Ge2021}, this approach did not account for the inherent variability in the acoustic properties of speech and individual differences in perception. The exploratory extension addressed these gaps by examining how fine-grained acoustic variation and individual abilities influence prosodic focus processing. 

\subsubsection{Acoustics and acoustic sensitivity}

The acoustic properties of the stimuli played a significant role in shaping fixation patterns, revealing that prosodic focus effects were not uniform across speech tokens. Rather than reflecting a simple effect of focus marking, word duration, pitch range, and stress prominence interacted with individual acoustic sensitivity, determining how listeners allocated attention to different referents.

In the first phrase target model, a negative effect of duration indicated that shorter words resulted in fewer fixations to the target. This suggests that listeners were more likely to use prosodic cues to direct their attention when focus-marked words were acoustically prominent, particularly when their duration was lengthened in line with \cite{Breen2010,Ge2021,ge2021comprehension}. Similarly, in the first phrase competitor model, a positive interaction between duration d$’$ (individual sensitivity to duration contrasts) and word duration indicated that listeners with higher duration sensitivity were more likely to fixate on competitors when words had longer durations. This suggests that perception of prosodic prominence is contingent on both the acoustic properties of speech and the listener’s ability to track duration-based prominence cues. These results are in line with recent results of Italian stress perception that suggest that it is not just the duration of stressed Italian words that matters, but also the listeners' ability to perceive the duration differences \citep{ppcc}.

Pitch variation also influenced fixation behavior. In the second phrase competitor model, a positive interaction between pitch d’ and pitch range  indicated that listeners with greater pitch sensitivity were more likely to fixate on competitors when words had a larger pitch range. This suggests that prosodic focus effects were enhanced for listeners who could perceive fine-grained pitch variations, leading them to shift fixations toward competitors when pitch was exaggerated. Together, these findings highlight that prosodic focus processing is not solely driven by categorical stress marking; but instead, the acoustic properties of speech interact with individual auditory sensitivity to shape fixation patterns dynamically. 

\subsubsection{Acoustics and Rhythm/Melody Abilities}

Beyond basic acoustic sensitivity, listeners’ rhythm and melody abilities further influenced how they processed prosodic focus. These higher-level perceptual skills—often linked to musical training—moderated the extent to which fixations aligned with prosodic prominence in the speech signal especially at the later parts of the sentence (second phrases).

In the first phrase target model, a negative interaction between pitch range and melodic ability revealed that listeners with lower melodic abilities exhibited fewer fixations to the target when pitch range was compressed. This suggests that prosodic focus effects were stronger for listeners who could track pitch variation with greater precision—when the pitch range was reduced, those with weaker melodic skills failed to fixate as reliably on focus-marked words. A similar trend was observed in the first phrase competitor model, where a positive interaction between melody and pitch range indicated that listeners with greater melodic ability fixated more on competitors when pitch range was exaggerated. This suggests that musically skilled listeners were more sensitive to prosodic variation, shifting their attention in response to subtle acoustic differences. This strongly supports \cite{jansen2023influence}, which found the positive effects of music on perception of L2 focus prosody and, more generally, supports claims for domain-general auditory processing \citep{saito2022does, bramlett_wiener_24_speechprosody, bakkouche2025effects, Kachlicka_Saito_Tierney_2019}.


\subsubsection{Cognitive Factors: Working Memory, Cognitive Control, and LexTALE}

Despite their hypothesized role in prosodic processing, cognitive factors such as working memory, cognitive control, and lexical proficiency (LexTALE) did not significantly predict fixation behavior. This does not necessarily mean that these predictors do not contribute to focus processing. There are at least three explanations for our null results. First, we did not have a large enough sample. This is most likely true for our L1 Dutch-L2 English participants (N = 27). Second, our specific population was at or near ceiling in many tasks. Take the LexTALE for example. The L1 Dutch-L2 English group scored very high on the LexTALE task, with many participants actually outperforming L1 English participants. It is not clear if a wider range of English proficiency may lead to more varying results. Third, the look-and-listen task may require fewer cognitive resources than a word recognition task involving choices and greater attention. This is an empirical question and beyond the scope of this study. We tentatively conclude that our look-and-listen results were shaped more by perceptual abilities than by cognitive resources.


\subsection{Moving Beyond L1-L2 Differences}

In sum, our exploration findings extend our replication and refinement by demonstrating that prosodic focus processing is not solely driven by language background (L1 vs. L2) but is shaped by a combination of acoustic properties of stimuli and listener-specific traits. While \cite{Ge2021} attributed differences in focus processing to L1 effects, our results suggest that domain-general listener-specific auditory and cognitive abilities play a more central role than previously assumed \citep{saito2022does, bramlett_wiener_24_speechprosody, bakkouche2025effects, Kachlicka_Saito_Tierney_2019}.

First, fixations to focus-marked referents were systematically modulated by acoustic properties such as pitch range and word duration, rather than being an invariant effect of prosodic marking. This suggests that prosodic processing is highly stimulus-dependent, meaning that prosodic focus effects are not universal but contingent on specific acoustic realizations of stress and prominence.

Second, L1-L2 differences in prosodic processing were less stable than assumed. While previous studies suggested that non-native listeners exhibit a uniform delay, our results show that fixation patterns are better predicted by individual differences in auditory sensitivity tied to specific acoustic properties of the stimuli \citep{xie2023adaptive}. In other words, prosodic processing is highly individualized, and L2 delays may reflect perceptual and cognitive variability rather than a fixed group-level effect. 

Finally, our results highlight the importance of including individual differences in speech perception research L1 and L2 research. By integrating auditory perception, cognitive control, and lexical proficiency, we provide a more nuanced account of prosodic focus processing, moving beyond broad group-level contrasts to uncover how individual listeners dynamically adapt to prosodic cues in real time. Traditional L1/L2 comparisons often treat native language effects as a black box, attributing differences in speech processing to categorical group distinctions without specifying the underlying mechanisms. However, this approach lacks parsimony, as it assumes that L1 itself is the explanatory factor rather than identifying the perceptual and cognitive mechanisms that drive these differences. Our findings suggest that focus processing is better explained through mechanistic factors such as individual variation in acoustic sensitivity (e.g., pitch d$’$, duration d$’$) and cognitive control, rather than broad L1 effects. This more parsimonious framework accounts for why some L2 speakers approach native-like processing while some L1 speakers do not consistently exhibit the expected pattern. Rather than treating L1 effects as static, we show that they emerge from individual differences in sensitivity to speech cues, aligning with adaptive models of speech perception \citep{xie2023adaptive}. Future work should move beyond categorical L1/L2 distinctions and instead focus on how variation in perceptual and cognitive traits modulates speech processing across speakers, providing a more mechanistic and theoretically grounded explanation of prosodic processing. This is not to say that the effects found in \cite{Ge2021} are not real or valid, but rather that those effects are tied to the particular individuals tested and effect may not generalize to other samples, like our sample.


\subsubsection{Limitations}

While this study provides valuable insights into the replication of prosodic focus processing, several limitations should be acknowledged. First, the use of web-based eye-tracking introduces variability in gaze data due to differences in participant screen sizes, webcam qualities, and environmental conditions. Although we implemented stringent calibration procedures and data filtering, the lower sampling rate compared to lab-based studies may have affected the temporal precision of fixation patterns. Future research should further validate web-based methods against high-resolution lab-based eye-tracking.

Second, our replication was limited by the absence of L1 Cantonese participants due to geopolitical constraints. Since the original study found differences between L1 Dutch and L1 Cantonese speakers, we were unable to assess whether web-based methods reproduce these cross-linguistic effects. Additionally, given that Dutch participants were recruited via Prolific, individual differences in language exposure and proficiency may have contributed to variation in results. Future studies should explore whether participant recruitment methods influence replication outcomes.

Third, while our statistical approach using Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) and LASSO-based feature selection provided a more nuanced analysis of fixation dynamics, it also introduced complexity in model interpretation. The inclusion of multiple individual difference measures allowed for a richer understanding of variability in focus processing, but further replications with larger and more diverse samples are needed to determine the generalizability of these findings.

Finally, our study highlights the importance of incorporating acoustic properties into analyses of focus processing. Our stimuli were constructed sentences rather than fully natural speech, which may have limited the variability in acoustic cues available to listeners. A more comprehensive approach could involve testing a broader, naturally varying acoustic space to assess whether prosodic focus processing is influenced by fine-grained phonetic variation. Future work should investigate how individual differences interact with prosodic variation across a more ecologically valid range of speech input.

By addressing these limitations, future research can refine our understanding of how prosodic focus is processed across different speaker populations and methodological contexts.
